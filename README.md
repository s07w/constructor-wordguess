# Constructor Word Guess

This assignment required (no pun intended) the use of different required javascript files in node to create a word guess game. It also uses the Inquirer NPM to prompt the user to provide inputs to play the game. This game is guitar-brand themed with the ostensible goal of choosing which brand of guitar the user will play that night.

## How the game works
* The user is prompted to enter a letter after the game loads. Then, the results will be displayed. 
* Hidden letters that have yet to be guessed are represented as underscores. 
* If the user successfully chose a correct letter, it will replace the underscore. 
* The user has 15 guesses to correctly guess the word.

## Challenges

Getting all three of the JS files to behave was very difficult. I found that the simpler the code was, the easier it was to debug. It was much less error-prone as well! Since the constructors had a fair amount of overlap, console.log was imperative to figure out which parts of the code overall weren't working. 

## Technology Used
NPM, js.Node, Inquirer npm, Javacript with object constructors.
